This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

## Initial firebase database
Create a project in firebase and copy-paste your firebase configuration in the /config/firebaseConfig.js folder to make the app work.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
